# Notes On Course Delivery

## Sam F

- We were unable to deliver all of the course content. I personally believe
that the sections on GitHub aren't 100% required here. The course is on version
control, not git. As such the sections on GitHub (whilst certainly applicable)
aren't really in the spirit of the course.
    - I still think the sections on GitHub are useful, but a lot of the content
    surrounding GitHub is more in line with best practices rather than version
    control. I think it would be a good idea to have a separate course covering
    GitHub (PRs, issues, milestones, *etc.*)
- This point has been made previously, but I'm not sure the content on markdown
is strictly necessary either. What does this actually contribute other than
loading more information into the course?
    - Again, markdown is genuinely very useful (as made evident by the fact
    that I'm writing this in markdown). However it has nothing to do with
    version control, why is it in this course? You could easily get away with
    a simple text file with no markup at all.
