# Notes On Course Delivery

## Sam F

### What went well

- There was a great deal of partipant questions
    - Indicates participants were engaged
    - Indicates that partipants were not lost (unable to even formulate their
    question)
- The content delivered had very few interuptions and from my perspective had
a good pace to it.
    - Of course we will need to wait to see if the participants concur

### What went wrong

- We were unable to deliver all of the course content
- Turnout was 20-30% worse in the second session
    - Currently unsure as to exactly why this was

### Future suggestions

-  I personally believe that the sections on GitHub aren't 100% required here.
The course is on version control, not git. As such the sections on GitHub
(whilst certainly applicable) aren't really in the spirit of the course.
    - I still think the sections on GitHub are useful, but a lot of the content
    surrounding GitHub is more in line with best practices rather than version
    control. I think it would be a good idea to have a separate course covering
    GitHub (PRs, issues, milestones, *etc.*)
- I'm not sure the content on markdown is strictly necessary either. What does
this actually contribute other than loading more information into the course?
    - Again, markdown is genuinely very useful (as made evident by the fact
    that I'm writing this in markdown). However it has nothing to do with
    version control, why is it in this course? You could easily get away with
    a simple text file with no markup at all.
- A large proportion of questions (in the chat or in the breaks) were general
unix command line ones in the first session. Obviously I cannot know for
certain, but it felt like the prerequisites for the course were ignored by
many participants.
    - This is a problem I've seen on a lot of CFRR courses and I'm not too sure
    on a good solution. Of course you can gate course enrollment with a quiz
    or something (or even check which courses the potential participant has
    previously completed), however this would mean less people would learn the
    wonders of version control.
- This has always been difficult to implenent in CFRR courses (especially
online ones like this), but I would love to see more engagement/activities with
the participants. Watching someone type git commands then copying them is a
good start, but you'll never become confident this way.
    - From my experience, most newcomers take the new knowledge on quite
    quickly. However they don't end up using it in their work due to a lack of
    confidence. Over time, this results in them forgetting the syntax and
    completely giving up on version control all together.
    - git is a big scary program that has unbelievably long man pages and feels
    like a black box until you've spent a long time with it. Getting some
    practice reps would go a long way in my opinion.
    - From what I've seen, newcomers are happy with the syntax (after a bit of
    time using it), but are afraid of the consequences of their actions. They
    need to be shown that it is difficult to lose their work/code and feel
    confident that they can revert any changes they make if something actually
    does go wrong.
