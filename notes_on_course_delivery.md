# Notes On Course Delivery

## Sam F

- We were unable to deliver all of the course content. I personally believe
that the sections on GitHub aren't 100% required here. The course is on version
control, not git. As such the sections on GitHub (whilst certainly applicable)
aren't really in the spirit of the course.
    - I still think the sections on GitHub are useful, but a lot of the content
    surrounding GitHub is more in line with best practices rather than version
    control. I think it would be a good idea to have a separate course covering
    GitHub (PRs, issues, milestones, *etc.*)
